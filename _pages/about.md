I'm a Computer Science student at NYU Courant, working with [Prof. Jinyang Li](https://jinyangli.github.io/) and [Prof. Aurojit Panda](https://cs.nyu.edu/~apanda/) on system optimizations for 3D reconstruction. Before that, I worked with [Prof. Dennis Shasha](https://cs.nyu.edu/~shasha/) on a blockchain system called [Bounce](https://github.com/bounce-blockchain/bounce-core).

I'm broadly interested in building fast systems for machine learning pipelines.
