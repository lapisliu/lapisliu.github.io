I'm a senior Computer Science undergrad at New York University, working in [Prof. Jinyang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MrWIWNwAAAAJ)'s group on machine learning systems. Previously, I worked with [Prof. Dennis Shasha](https://cs.nyu.edu/~shasha/) on a scalable blockchain named [Bounce](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8732/5/2/9). I'm broadly interested in distributed systems, high-performance computing, cloud, and systems for machine learning.
