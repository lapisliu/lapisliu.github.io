I'm a Computer Science student at NYU Courant, working with [Prof. Jinyang Li](https://jinyangli.github.io/) and [Prof. Aurojit Panda](https://cs.nyu.edu/~apanda/) on system optimizations for 3D reconstruction. Previously, I worked with [Prof. Dennis Shasha](https://cs.nyu.edu/~shasha/) on a scalable blockchain named [Bounce](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8732/5/2/9). I'm broadly interested in building fast systems for machine learning pipelines.
